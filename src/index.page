I am a first-year [Mphil][] student in [Department of Applied
Mathematics][] , [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University][], under the
supervision of [Dr. Zhao Xingqiu][] and [Dr. Ye Zhisheng][]. My research
interest is applied statistics. I would like to pursue Ph.D. in the
future.

I am widely interested in philosophy, computing science, social sciences
besides mathematics. <span style="color:white">Marxism,
</span>Neo-confucianism and Taoism have significant impact on me.

Currently, I am learning advanced math and statistics as well as
programming languages. I also decided to pick up badminton.
